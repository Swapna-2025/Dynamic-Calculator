## Hi, I'am **Swapna!**üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I have made a very interesting code by using Google Colab Notebook.
So, let's go with me...üëç
# DYNAMIC CALCULATOR
**Introduction:**
In Python, a "dynamic calculator" generally refers to a program or script that can adapt to different types of calculations based on user input, changing variables, or even different mathematical operations on the fly.A simple example of a dynamic calculator in Python might allow the user to choose which operation to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) and then calculate the result based on dynamic inputs.

**Key Features of a Dynamic Calculator in Python:**
Adaptability: The calculator can perform different operations depending on user input.
User Interaction: It interacts with the user, requesting inputs and providing results dynamically.
Real-Time Calculation: As soon as the user provides input, the calculator computes and displays the result instantly.

**Conclusion:**
A dynamic calculator in Python is a flexible program that can perform various mathematical operations based on user input, dynamically adjusting to different scenarios. It allows the user to choose operations, input values, and get results in real-time.In short, a dynamic calculator in Python can adapt to a wide range of operations and user inputs, making it a powerful tool for performing various calculations programmatically.
